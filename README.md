## About this project
Using the new React skills to help to help showcase the new skills in technologies.
Need to deploy this application to GitHub Pages.

## User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, the user wants to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Criteria
A single-page application portfolio for a web developer needs to be build with the following criteria

* When the user load the portfolio, then the user presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* When the user view the header, then the user presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* When the user view the navigation titles, then the user presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* When the user click on a navigation title, then the user presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
* When the user load the portfolio the first time, then the About Me title and section are selected by default
* When the user presented with the About Me section, then the user see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* When the user presented with the Portfolio section, then the user see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
* When the user presented with the Contact section, then the user see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
* When the user move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, then the user receive a notification that this field is required
* When the user enter text into the email address field, then the user receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
* When the user am presented with the Resume section, then the user see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
* When the user view the footer, then the user presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## Technical Criteria

* A single Header component that appears on multiple pages
* A single Navigation component within the header that will be used to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio
* A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section
* A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages
* The email address and phone number added on the Contact page.

### Projects
For each project you feature in your portfolio, you should include the following:
* An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)
* The title of the project
* A link to the deployed application
* A link to the corresponding GitHub repository
### Design
* Use mobile-first design.
* Chooses a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. 
* The font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* Application uses React to render content.
* Application has a single Header component that appears on multiple pages, with a Navigation component within it that’s used to conditionally render About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections.
* Application has a single Project component that’s used multiple times in the Portfolio section.
* Application has a single Footer component that appears on multiple pages.
* Application must be deployed to GitHub Pages.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
